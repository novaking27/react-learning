## About The Project
Very Basic but usful todo application, This is first react app i have made. Todo Apps seem to be a great place to start for learning how to interact with a database
- adding 
- removing
- editing
  
in this case i was using "firebase" as my database.

this was superfun and great way to learn on how to build with react.
